# Instruction for Unit Test course project
The first assigment ist normally the hardest as you are not atuned to C#. Keep your head up high and if needed consult the extra (zoom) sessions. 
I rated the tasks from 1-3 as 1 beeing the easiest 3 beeing the hardes. However, your milage may vary.

The assignment consists of 3 subtastks. Analyse code, Write Unittests (see lecture), Programing (to fullfill Unittests). These subtasks are not ordered by toughness.
Expect 1.1.2 to be harder than most of the tasks of 1.2 or 1.3. 

Inside the task, the order is chronological. Start with the first test and work you way down to the bottom. 

## 1.1 Code Analysis
First part is to analyse and understand code snippets. In the file **CodeSnippets.cs** there are two seperate independet functions provided . 
Formulate a the general idea what the function is doing and when it should be used and explain the code with comments. The comments can be found at **CodeSnippets.cs**.


## 1.2 Write UnitTests
In file **WriteTestsHere.cs** are 12 UnitTests based on functions in **CodeSnippets.cs**.
Also comments on what should be tested and why is represented in **WriteTestsHere.cs**.

## 1.3. Programming
Turning the task around, the goal is now to finish functions based on the given Unittests in the file **ToBeWritten.cs**

## Grading
Grading will be taken based on readablity, comments, code quality and test coverage.
