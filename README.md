# Instruction for Assignment #1
The first assigment ist normally the hardest as you are not atuned to C#. Keep your head up high and if needed consult the extra (zoom) sessions. 
I rated the tasks from 1-3 as 1 beeing the easiest 3 beeing the hardes. However, your milage may vary.

The assignment consists of 3 subtastks. Analyse code, Write Unittests (see lecture), Programing (to fullfill Unittests). These subtasks are not ordered by toughness.
Expect 1.1.2 to be harder than most of the tasks of 1.2 or 1.3. 

Inside the task, the order is chronological. Start with the first test and work you way down to the bottom. 

## 1.1 Code Analysis
First part is to analyse and understand code snippets. In the file **CodeSnippets.cs** there are two seperate independet functions provided . 
Please look at the code an reason about it. You should formulate a the general idea what the function is doing and when it should be used. Generally this should be ~50 words. 
Additionally you should explain the code with comments. 

Try to formulate the comments as short and concicse as you see fit. 
While rough comments can be enough, you may find yourself wanting more steps for analysis. In this case fine grained comments maybe the way to go.

## 1.2 Write UnitTests
In file **WriteTestsHere.cs** are 12 empty UnitTests. Please complete these Unittests so the written code is tested. You are not allowed to modify the signatures !
Also provide comments on what you want to test and why. 

## 1.3. Programming
Turning the task around, you goal is now to provide functions based on the given Unittests in the file **ToBeWritten.cs**. Again you are not allowed to modify the given signatures. 
However you are allowed to add new classes, methods and functions. Use a step by step approach to pass on test after another. Also look at the comments provided (also in SimpleShop.cs). 


## Grading
Grading will include readablity, comments, code quality and test coverage. For Questions use the moodle forum and the extra FAQ that will be provided.
